GitHub Copilot: The terminal selection context refers to the text that is currently selected (highlighted) in the terminal. In this case, the selected text is:

```
git config --global user.email "JimVekemans@hotmail.com"
‚ùØ git commit -S -m "Added readme about signing commits"
error: gpg failed to sign the data:
gpg: skipped "Jim Vekemans <JimVekemans@hotmail.com>": No secret key
[GNUPG:] INV_SGNR 9 Jim Vekemans <JimVekemans@hotmail.com>
[GNUPG:] FAILURE sign 17
gpg: signing failed: No secret key
fatal: failed to write commit object
```

Git is unable to find the GPG key for signing the commits. Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. List your GPG keys:
```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
```
2. From the list of GPG keys, copy the GPG key ID you'd like to use. In this example, the GPG key ID is `3AA5C34371567BD2`:

```bash
/Users/hubot/.gnupg/secring.gpg
---------------------------------
sec   4096R/3AA5C34371567BD2 2016-03-10 [expires: 2017-03-10]
uid                          Hubot 
ssb   4096R/42B317FD4BA89E7A 2016-03-10
```

3. Set the GPG key in Git:
```bash
git config --global user.signingkey 3AA5C34371567BD2
```
Replace `3AA5C34371567BD2` with your GPG key ID.

4. Ensure that the email address associated with the GPG key is the same as the one used in your Git commit configuration. You can check your Git commit email address with:
```bash
git config --global user.email
```
If it's not the same, you can set it with:
```bash
git config --global user.email "JimVekemans@hotmail.com"
```

5. Also, ensure that the GPG key is trusted. You can edit the key to trust it:
```bash
gpg --edit-key 3AA5C34371567BD2
```
Replace `3AA5C34371567BD2` with your GPG key ID. Then, at the gpg command prompt, type `trust`, select `5 = I trust ultimately`, and then `quit`.

6. Finally, if you're using GPG Suite, ensure that in the GPG Suite preferences, under `Git`, the option `Enable Git support` is checked.

The terminal selection context refers to the text that is currently selected (highlighted) in the terminal. In this case, the selected text is:

```
git commit -S -m "Added readme about signing commits"
error: gpg failed to sign the data:
[GNUPG:] KEY_CONSIDERED XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 2
[GNUPG:] BEGIN_SIGNING H10
[GNUPG:] PINENTRY_LAUNCHED 20449 curses 1.2.1 - xterm-256color :0 - 1000/1000 0
gpg: signing failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device
[GNUPG:] FAILURE sign XXXXXXXX
gpg: signing failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device
fatal: failed to write commit object
```

This selection shows a sequence of commands and their output. The user tried to commit with a signed commit message using Git, but the commit failed because of an "Inappropriate ioctl for device" error. This error typically occurs when GPG tries to use the pinentry program to get the passphrase for the GPG key, but it can't because the terminal doesn't support the operation.

jimvekemans: How do I fix this?

GitHub Copilot: The error "Inappropriate ioctl for device" typically happens when GPG tries to prompt for the passphrase in a context where it can't. This can happen if you're running the command in a non-interactive shell or a system without a proper TTY setup.

A common solution is to tell GPG to use a specific pinentry mode. You can do this by adding the following line to your `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf` file:

```bash
echo "pinentry-mode loopback" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
```

This tells GPG to use the loopback mode for pinentry, which allows GPG to prompt for the passphrase directly in the terminal.

After adding this line, try to commit again:

```bash
git commit -S -m "Your commit message"
```

If you're still having issues, make sure that the `gpg-agent` is configured to allow loopback pinentry by adding the following line to your `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf` file:

```bash
echo "allow-loopback-pinentry" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
```

Then, reload the `gpg-agent`:

```bash
gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye
```

Now, try to commit again.
