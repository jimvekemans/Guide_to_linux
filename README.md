# Ubuntu / Pop!_OS
#### Reasons to choose for an ubuntu installation:
- Package availability: Most popular software has a .deb file that your can use and might even come with detailed instructions.
- Stability: Ubuntu comes with both LTS (long term support) and interim releases. The LTS releases from ubuntu are generally considered to be very stable. Instability is usually caused by the user and not the system. Software packages get tested for longer in LTS releases, the tradeoff for stability is that you may not have the bleeding edge of software available (yet).
- Troubleshooting: If you're experiencing issues then chances are that someone somewhere has posted about it and most likely that thread will have steps to fix them in ubuntu (since the majority of all linux users use ubuntu).

# Archlinux / Manjaro
#### Reasons to choose for an archlinux based installation:
- Package availability: You don't have to get mad on the web searching for packages for your distro (if any) , you just install them from AUR (if they're not in the official repositories) and that's really simple and quick. Everything is in the AUR.
- Stability: Archlinux requires time and patience to install properly but it's rock solid after completion. During installation you pick up the skills you need to better troubleshoot issues that may arise in the future. The fact that it's a rolling release avoids the headache of major updates (although you do have to update frequently).
- Cutting edge software: New updates for software are available very quickly after release. Packages are tested for stablity and given clearance in days while ubuntu does testing for months. Again, 
- Wiki: you can find everything in the Archwiki and you can probably solve every issue you have just reading it (at least in my experience). Basic understanding of your system goes a long way in solving problems where you can't copy-paste an answer from stackexchange.
